    <h4>
        BIOLOGY AS A SCIENCE OF LIFE
    </h4>

    <p style="font-size: large;">
        <span style="color: rgb(27, 13, 148); background-color: rgb(204, 238, 14);">Biology</span> is a natural science concerned with the study of living organisms. The term biology is coined from the Greek words for life (bios) and study (logia). Life science is very often used as an alternative name for biology.

    <h4>
        BRANCHES OF BIOLOGY
    </h4>

    <p style="font-size: large;">
        Traditionally, biology is divided into <span style="background-color: yellow;">zoology</span> and <span style="background-color: yellow;">botany</span> . <span style="color: red;">Zoology</span> is the study of animals and <span style="color: red;">Botany</span> is the study of plants.
