    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to TikTok Video Downloader HD (“we,” “our,” “us”). This Privacy Policy describes how our TikTok video downloader Android app (“App”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use our App, which also displays advertisements (“Ads”).

    </p>
    <h3>b. Non-Personal Information:</h3>
    <p>
      We may automatically collect non-personal information such as device type, operating system, unique device identifiers, IP address, and usage data (e.g., app interactions, downloads, and crash reports) through third-party analytics and advertising partners.

      <li>Ensuring the security and integrity of our App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Advertisements and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Our App displays Ads provided by third-party advertising networks. These third parties may collect information about your device and use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to serve personalized Ads based on your interests. We do not control these practices, and this Privacy Policy does not cover the collection and use of your information by third parties. Please review the privacy policies of any third-party advertisers for more details.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties without your consent except as described below:

        <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share non-personal or aggregated data with trusted service providers to help us operate our App, analyze usage, and deliver Ads.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required by law, or in the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with legal obligations or protect our rights.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect the security of your information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security and encourage you to use caution when sharing personal information online.
