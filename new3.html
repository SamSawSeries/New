The five levels of organization in multicellular organisms in sequence are the cells, tissues, organ, systems, and organisms.</p>

The two basic types of cells are prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are smaller and simpler in form. Eukaryotic cells are more specialized in their structure than the prokaryotic cells.</p>

The cells which form a tissue need not be identical but have the same origin. The different types of animal tissues which form organs are the nervous, muscle, connective and epithelial tissues, blood tissue, and skeletal tissue. Plant tissues include photosynthetic tissue (palisade and spongy mesophylls), epidermal tissue, strengthening tissue (collenchyma, parenchyma, and sclerenchyma), and conducting tissue (xylem and phloem).</p>
