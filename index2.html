     An eukaryotic cell has a nucleus which is bounded by a nuclear membrane. Most eukaryotic cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles such as <span  style="background-color: yellow">mitochondria; chloroplasts and the Golgi apparatus</span>. Examples of eukaryotic cells include all protoc tists, fungi, green plants and animals.

     An organelle is a minute membrane-bound structure within a eukaryotic cell that performs specific functions.
     Some major organelles that are suspended in the cytosol are the mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, the
     Golgi apparatus, vacuoles, lysosomes, and in plant cells, chloroplasts.

     The nucleus is a membrane-bound spherical structure that contains the cell's hereditary information and controls the cell’s
     growth and reproduction. It is the most prominent organelle in the cell. The nucleus is composed of jelly-like nuclear sap
     called the <strong>nucleoplasm</strong> (also called karyoplasm). It has three main components: the nuclear envelope, the nucleolus, and
     the chromatin.
   </p>
   
   
   <p style="font-size: 19px; margin: 20px auto;

   background-color: #fff;
   box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); text-align: left;">
     
     The nuclear envelope has nuclear pores to control the movement of molecules between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. This membrane separates the contents of the nu cleus from the cytoplasm. The chromatin is a complex of DNA and protein that forms long, thin, entangled threads called chromosomes. Chromosomes contain DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) which provides the genetic information necessary for the production of other cell components and for the reproduction of life. Within the nucleus is a nucleolus, whose function is to produce ribosomes.

     It is a sausage-shaped or spindle-shaped organelle surrounded by a double-layer membrane, with the inner membrane folded to form a network of partitions called <strong>cristae</strong>, which project into the inside of the matrix of the mitochondrion and contain enzymes and DNA. Its function is the production of ATP or energy during cellular respiration in the cristae network.

     Mitochondria are popularly called the “power house of the cell” as they furnish the cell with all the energy required (ATP) for locomotion, cell division, production of secretory products, etc. The number of mitochondria present in cells may vary depending on the cell’s activity.
