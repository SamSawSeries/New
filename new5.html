        Mechanisms for movement of molecules
      </div>
    </center>
    <hr>
    
    <p>
      Molecules move in and out of a cell through the cell membrane, which forms the boundary of each cell. The cell membrane is selectively permeable to substances, which means that it permits entry and exit of certain molecules only. The movement of molecules takes place by diffusion, osmosis, and active transport.

Put two drops of the perfume on the floor and move to the opposite end of the classroom.

      Half fill a beaker with water and put a grain of potassium permanganate into the water in the beaker. Leave the beaker on a flat table for about 40 minutes. After sometime the particles of the potassium permanganate spread to other parts of the water in the beaker and eventually the colour becomes the same all through the liquid. That means that the particles of potassium permanganate have diffused evenly through the water.

      Osmosis can be explained by the fact that less concentrated solution contains more free energy, so solvent molecules tend to diffuse to a place of lower free energy in order to equalize free energy.
